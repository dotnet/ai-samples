A user story title is a summary of the user story's contents. 
It is short but descriptive, and team members can refer to the title of the story and be easily understood by the rest of the team.

An example of acceptance criteria for a user story for creating a demo envirionment is:

1. The demo environment should be created using a script that can be run with a single command.
2. The demo environment should include all necessary components of the application, such as the database and web server.
3. The demo environment should be isolated from other environments to prevent interference.
4. The demo environment should be easy to tear down and recreate as needed.
