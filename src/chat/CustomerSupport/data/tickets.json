I have thoroughly researched the technical specifications of the BPA-free reservoir material properties, including the ASTM D5116-16, ISO 10993-1:2018, and FDA Title 21CFR177.1520 standards. I am confident that the proprietary blend of polyethylene, known as Hydratech 3000, will meet the stringent requirements of my intended use. Additionally, the flow dynamics of the bite valve are of particular interest to me as I require optimal liquid flow for my purposes. I understand that Thirsttrek engineers have conducted thorough analysis, including Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling and measurement of flow rates and forces using a hydraulic test bench. I believe that this level of engineering precision aligns with my needs. However, I would appreciate further information or assistance in ensuring that the adjustable straps are suitable for my intended use. Your prompt and detailed response would be greatly appreciated."
