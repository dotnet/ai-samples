This project demonstrates how to integrate an AI model using the Microsoft Semantic Kernel within a .NET web application. The example includes setting up a chat completion service with OpenAI's GPT models and injecting the Semantic Kernel into the application's services.
### Initializing the Web Application Builder
We create a web application builder and add the Semantic Kernel service to it.
```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddKernel();
```
#### Adding OpenAI Chat Completion Service
The code adds the OpenAI chat completion service to the kernel. The model used is "gpt-4-turbo", but you can replace it with other models if needed. The OpenAI API key is retrieved from the environment variables.
```csharp
# pragma warning disable CS0618
var kernel = builder.Services.AddOpenAIChatCompletion(openAIChatCompletionModelName, Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("OPENAI_API_KEY"));
```
### Building and Configuring the Application
```Charp
var app = builder.Build();

app.MapGet("/WeatherForecast", async (Kernel kernel) =>
{
    int temp = Random.Shared.Next(-20, 55);
    return new WeatherForecast
    (
        DateOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now),
        temp,
        await kernel.InvokePromptAsync<string>($"Short description of weather at {temp}0c?") // This description will be generated by the AI model for the given temperature.
    );
});
app.Run();
```
