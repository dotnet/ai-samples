## Console Chat Application with Stateful Chat AI

This console application demonstrates a basic chat interface using OpenAI's GPT model (such as GPT-3.5-Turbo or GPT-4-Turbo) through the Microsoft Semantic Kernel. The application maintains a stateful chat interface, where it continuously takes user input and provides responses generated by the AI model, while remembering previous contexts.
### Chat Service
`kernel.GetRequiredService<IChatCompletionService>()` retrieves the chat completion service from the kernel.

#### Chat History
Named `chatHistory` is used to store the conversation history. Each user message and AI response is appended to this list, maintaining the context of the conversation.

By maintaining a chat history, the application ensures that the AI model can remember previous contexts and provide more coherent and contextually relevant responses.
