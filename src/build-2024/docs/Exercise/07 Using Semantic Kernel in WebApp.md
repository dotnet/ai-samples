# Exercise - Using Semantic Kernel in WebApp

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to integrate an AI model using the Microsoft Semantic Kernel within a .NET web application. The example includes setting up a chat completion service with OpenAI's GPT models and injecting the Semantic Kernel into the application's services.

> For full code explnation please refer readme for `02 - Add Chat History` project  [README.md](../02%20-%20Add%20Chat%20History/README.md).

- **Initializing the Web Application Builder**

We create a web application builder and add the Semantic Kernel service to it.

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddKernel();
```

- **Configuring the web Application**

This code defines an endpoint `/WeatherForecast` in a web app that returns a weather forecast. It generates a random temperature and uses an AI model to provide a short description of the weather at that temperature.

```Charp
var app = builder.Build();
app.MapGet("/WeatherForecast", async (Kernel kernel) =>
{
    int temp = Random.Shared.Next(-20, 55);
    return new WeatherForecast
    (
        DateOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now),
        temp,
        await kernel.InvokePromptAsync<string>($"Short description of weather at {temp} degrees Celsius") // This description will be generated by the AI model for the given temperature.
    );
});
app.Run();
```
