# Exercise - Using Semantic Kernel in WebApp

# Create the web application

1. Run the following command on `PowerShell` to create a new .NET  web application named **07 - Using Semantic Kernel in WebApp**.

  ```shell
  dotnet new webapp -n 07 - Using Semantic Kernel in WebApp
  ```

2. Switch to the newly created `07 - Using Semantic Kernel in WebApp` directory.

```shell
cd 07 - Using Semantic Kernel in WebApp
```

3. Install Semantic Kernel nuget package

```shell
dotnet add package Microsoft.SemanticKernel
```

4. Install Swashbuckle.AspNetCore nuget package

```shell
dotnet add package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore
```

5. Open the project in VS Code or Visual Studio.

6. In the Program.cs file, delete all the existing code.

7. Add the following using statments at the top of `Program.cs` file.

```cshap
using Microsoft.SemanticKernel;
```

8. Add model name and initialize web application builder

```csharp
var openAIChatCompletionModelName = "gpt-4-turbo"; // this could be other models like "gpt-4o".
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
```

9. Add Kernel to web builder 

```csharp
builder.Services.AddKernel();
```

10. Add `AddOpenAIChatCompletion` sevice to the web buider and build the app

```csharp

 // This should work for any other service you can decided to use E.g Mistral.
var kernel = builder.Services.AddOpenAIChatCompletion(openAIChatCompletionModelName, Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("OPENAI_API_KEY"));
var app = builder.Build();
```

11. Run the web app for returning `WeatherForecast` conatin today's data for a temprature with a short summary of the weather. The short summary of the eather is generated bu AI by provising a prompt with a temprature.

```csharp

app.MapGet("/WeatherForecast", async (Kernel kerel) =>
{
    int temp = Random.Shared.Next(-20, 55);
    return new WeatherForecast
    (
        DateOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now),
        temp,
        await kerel.InvokePromptAsync<string>($"Short description of weather at {temp} degrees Celsius") // This description will be generated by the AI model for the given temperature.
    );
});
app.Run();

internal record WeatherForecast(DateOnly Date, int TempratureC, string Summary)
```

12 Run the application by entering `dotnet run` into the terminal.
 You will get an output similar to the following  for random temprature.

 ```json
 {
    "date": "2024-06-17",
    "tempratureC": 4,
    "summary": "At 4 degrees Celsius, the weather is cool and slightly chilly. It is above freezing, so there is no ice, but it's cold enough that you might want a jacket or sweater when outdoors. This temperature is typical for late autumn or early spring in temperate regions."
}
```
